# KurSL
*KurSL* is a mathematical model, which provides explaination for interacting oscillatory patterns. It is constructed of two components: Kuramoto coupling and Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation. The first one explains coupling between oscilaltors, and the latter provides a general oscillatory model. More details on the model will be provided at [homepage](https://www.laszukdawid.com).

# Examples
Below are examples produced using *KurSL*. The frst example was generated using *KurSL* of order 3 with 3 oscillators.
